    <p >I have attended many leadership masterclasses and learned many good leadership
      skills that will help me become a good leader who will transform Africa. Being a good
      leader also requires continuous learning and improvement, which is why I always try
      to learn from my role models in leadership and know where I can improve. I am also
      studying for my bachelor's degree in software engineering, which will help me to gain
      more technological knowledge to use in other to bring more transformation in the
      agriculture sector in order to improve myself to be able to actualize my leadership
      goals and become a better transformation leader.</p>

          journey of transformational leadership and mostly values-driven leadership.
